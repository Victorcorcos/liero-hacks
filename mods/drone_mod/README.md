This repository contains my own works regarding WEBLIERO - an online version (made by basro) of classic MS-DOS freeware game called LIERO made by Joosa Riekkinen and released in 1998. It contains my own mods (currently one - "Fun Roo Mod", based on Scharnvirk's Promode ReRevisited) made to this game and some maps. Enjoy!
---------------------------------------------------
To use the mod, run webliero in your browser, create your own room, then open the chat window (enter by default), type /loadmod in the console and select the mod from the directory (where you downloaded the mod). The mod was made using standard gfx from promode mod, so that it works the best with sprites from promode (you can also download sprites file from this repository - file sprites.wlsprt). So, to load the full mod, you should choose both files together (json and wlsprt file) after typing "loadmod" in the chat window.

As you can see, I uploaded 2 versions of my mod: first one containing all weapons (i.e. both new ones made by me and old ones from promode rerevisited), and the second one containing only new weapons made by me (the old ones are hidden by using //).

txt file "fun roo mod change list" contains description of the most significant changes I made in my mod, comparing to original one promode rerevisited version
