## Purpose 📌

The purpose of this repository is to put all the data that I find regarding the webliero game together.


## Webliero 🧨 🐛

Webliero is an online version of excellent game Liero made by Joosa Riekkinen and released in 1998.
You can play it for free in your browser at https://www.webliero.com/


## Mods 🔬

You can check some mods for the game located on the `/mods` directory.

Tou use a mod, you must.

- Download all its files (`.json5` and `.wlsprt` files) from relevant folder
- Open chat (`enter` by default)
- Type `/loadmod` and select both `mod.json5` (this contains "logic" changes of the mod) and `sprites.wlsprt` (this contains gfx changes of the mod)

Note, the `.json5` and `.wlsprt` files can be named any way you want, they just need to have the proper extensions.


## Dedicatory 🎁

I would like to thank all the people behind each one of these files ❤️

And also all the webliero players that still play this game! 🕹
