## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to put all the data that I find regarding the webliero game together.


## Webliero

Webliero is an online version of excellent game Liero made by Joosa Riekkinen and released in 1998.
You can play it for free in your browser at https://www.webliero.com/


## Mods

You can check some mods for the game located on the `/mods` directory.

Tou use a mod, you must.

- download all its files (`.json5` and `.wlsprt` files) from relevant folder
- open chat (`enter` by default)
- type `/loadmod` and select both `mod.json5` (this contains "logic" changes of the mod) and `sprites.wlsprt` (this contains gfx changes of the mod)

Note, the `.json5` and `.wlsprt` files can be named any way you want, but in my mods they will be like above.


## Dedicatory

I would like to thank all the people behind each one of these files ❤️ 
And also all the webliero players that still play this game!👨‍💻
