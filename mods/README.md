# Mod Guide ‚öôÔ∏è

This file documents the purpose behind each parameter of the `mod.json5` file, [like this one üêõ](https://pastebin.com/ztqCj6F8)

Few general assumptions:
- Game does 60 physics ticks, or "frames", per second.
- All times, durations etc are shown in frames.

## Soundpack üîâ

Which `soundpack` is used.

Those are stored server side and cannot be changed yet, you can only switch between few predetermined ones, for example:

1. sorliero.zip
2. promode.zip
3. csliero.zip
4. *under construction* üèóÔ∏è *(does someone know the other ones?)*

```js
soundpack: 'promode.zip',
```


## Constants üïπÔ∏è

The constants define general behavior of the mod, like physics, gravity, bonuses and ninja rope behaviors.

## Weapons üî´

A Weapon is a description on how the weapon itself works.

Think of it as if it was describing properties of the pistol itself, how does it affect you (recoil, noise, etc) but not the bullet.

```js
weapons: [
  {
    /*

      where it is in the array. I used comments denoting id of them - using a designation of weapon-id-x or "wid2" for example,
      but those are just that: comments. Only the actual position in array matters.
    */
    bulletType: 0,

    /*
       Base speed of the bullet. If too high, will pass through worms. 5 is about the max playable value for usual weapons.
       To make very fast gauss-like weapons, use "repeat" property.

    bulletSpeed: 5,

    /*
      Percentage of worm's speed applied to the bullet. WARNING: This is affected by "repeat"!

      The "laser" weapon will still obey delay between shots, but drawing of the laser itself will not. Laser will be drawn as long as you have 
      some ammo and you press fire, even if the weapon is in its "delay" state.

    laserBeam: false,

],
```


## wObjects üöÄ

`wObjects` are **objects shot by weapons**. (like gunshots)

Only weapons can produce them, and ordering in the array matters, counting from 0.

So for example if you have a chaingun bullet stored in third position, you need to use "bulletType: 2" in your weapon - because it is counted from 0.

```js
wObjects: [
  {

## Textures üé®

These `textures` parameters has the reference in `nObject`, `wObject` and `sObject` as `dirtEffect`s.

`dirtEffect` is a parameter present on all object types (`nObject`, `wObject` and `sObject`).

Changes here affects all dirts on the map and how the gunshots interact with them.

```js
textures: [
  {
    nDrawBack: true, // Related to create dirts on shots. Implications: https://i.imgur.com/FYmjd9g.png
    mFrame: 0, // Related to the size of dirtEffect. 0 is The biggest, 1 is medium, 2 is Small, 37 and 99 are rarher medium/small. Should not be changed from 0 unless you know what you are doing.
    sFrame: 73, // The sprite id of the dirtEffect. 73 cleans dirt pixels and makes background pixels. Should not be changed from 73, unless you change the orders in which sprites are placed on the `sprites.wlsprt` file. Implications: https://i.imgur.com/fGWyxRW.png
    rFrame: 2 // Related to the size of dirtEffect. 0 is The biggest, 1 is medium, 2 is Small, 37 and 99 are rarher medium/small. Should not be changed from 2 unless you know what you are doing.

#### Explanation

1. In `weapons` u have `bulletType`: refers to the `wObject` id. Created on gunshot.
2. In `wObject` u have `createOnExp`: refers to `sObject` id. Created on explosion.
3. In `wObject` u have `objTrailType`: refers to `sObject` id. Created on trail.
4. In `wObject` u have `splinterType`: refers to `nObject` id. Created on explosion. `splinterAmount` refers to the ammount.
5. In `wObject` u have `partTrailObj`: refers to `nObject` id. Created on trail.
6. In `nObject` u have `createOnExp`: refers to `sObject` id. Created on explosion.
7. In `nObject` u have `leaveObj`: refers to `sObject` id. Created on trail.
8. In `nObject` u have `splinterType`: refers to `nObject` id. Created on explosion. `splinterAmount` refers to the ammount.
